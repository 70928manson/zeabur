# Deploy n8n

[n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) is an extendable workflow automation tool. With a fair-code distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and apps. n8n's node-based approach makes it highly versatile, enabling you to connect anything to everything.

This article will show you how to deploy n8n with PostgreSQL on Zeabur.

## Step 1: Create a Project

First, we need to create a project on Zeabur. Go to the [Projects](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects) page, you will see all your projects, and the "Create Project" button is at the end of all projects.

## Step 2: Deploy PostgreSQL Service

n8n will store user identity data in a PostgreSQL database. Click "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace", you will find PostgreSQL in the list.

After selecting PostgreSQL, you can enter a custom name for the service and click Deploy.

## Step 3: Create a Database

In order for the n8n service to run properly, we need to create a database named `n8n` in the PostgreSQL database first.

Please connect to your PostgreSQL service with any PostgreSQL client first. In this article, we use [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/app-psql.html) to connect.

You can find the corresponding psql connection command or other connection information in the "Connection" block of the PostgreSQL service in the Zeabur console.

```bash
psql postgresql://root:password@infra.zeabur.com:12345
```

Next, please enter the following command in psql to create the `n8n` database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE n8n;
```

## Step 4: Deploy n8n Service

In the Zeabur console, click "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace", you will find n8n in the list.

  If you deploy n8n first without deploying PostgreSQL, then you need to restart
  the n8n service after deploying the PostgreSQL service to let n8n get the
  correct database connection information.
</Callout>

## Step 5: Bind a domain

In the "Domain" block of the n8n service in the Zeabur dashboard, you can bind a domain to it.

This domain can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

For more information about how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Bind a domain](../deploy/domain-binding).

## Step 6: Setup Account

After the deployment is complete, you can access your n8n service through the domain name you bound.

You will see a page like this:

![n8n Setup](/marketplace/n8n/setup.png)

Follow the instructions on the page to set up your n8n account. After the setup is complete, you can use n8n normally.
