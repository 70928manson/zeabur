# Plans

Zeabur offers different subscription plans for different needs.

Features and pricing can be found on [Zeabur's "Pricing" page](https://zeabur.com/en-US/pricing). This document mainly explains the target audience of each plan and supported payment methods.

## Free Plan

The Free Plan helps you evaluate Zeabur or launch small hobby or course projects. You will have a US$5 usage quota each month, which you can use to try out any services and features offered by Zeabur within the quota.

After the free quota for the month is used up, your service deployment will be temporarily suspended and you will have to manually restart the service next month.

## Developer Plan

The Developer Plan is suitable for all kinds of developers and small teams. In addition to generous resource quotas, higher support priority, and exclusive "Dev Plan" badge on the Discord server, you can also "pay as you go" and create various interesting applications with Zeabur without worrying about restrictions.

Supports credit card and Alipay payments.

The Developer Plan has a US$5 free quota each month:

- If your usage in a month does not exceed US$5, we will not charge you any additional fees other than this plan.
- If the usage exceeds US$5, the excess usage will be charged according to the formula in ["Pricing"](./pricing).

## Team Plan

The Team Plan is suitable for medium and large-scale, or projects with large resource requirements. In addition to providing more resource quotas, you can also directly connect with the Zeabur team to discuss various possibilities.

Supports credit card and Alipay payments. When you need other payment methods, you can communicate with us.

## Enterprise Plan

If the Team Plan does not meet your needs, you can [contact us](mailto:contact@zeabur.com) to get a plan tailored to your usage scenario.
