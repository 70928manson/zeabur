# Multi Environment

You may need some independent environments in a project.

Zeabur can help you with that.

## What is environment

An environment is where your services are running. It can be a server, a cluster, a cloud, or even a local machine.

Different environments are independent of each other. They can have different configurations, different services, and different versions of services.

Zeabur can help you to create multiple environments in a project.

## Why we need multiple environments

In a project, you may need to deploy your services to different environments. For example, you may need to deploy your services to a production environment and a development environment.

Production environment is for your customers. It should be stable and reliable. You should not deploy your services to production environment frequently.

Development environment is for your developers. It should be easy to deploy and test. You should deploy your services to development environment frequently.

## How to manage multiple environments

### Step 1: Create a new environment

After entering any project, click the **Add Environment** button and enter an environment name to create a new environment for your project.

After the environment is created, your services in the current project will be automatically copied, and re-deploy in your new environment.

Please note that, in addition to the environment variables exposed by the service itself, the environment variables in the original environment will not be copied.

### Step 2: Bind another branch

For your deployed source code, you can bind different branches in different environment for the same service.

Click on the service, scroll down and click on the settings tab, select the branch you want to bind to this environment in the **Switch Branch** section.

For example, if you choose the dev branch, then your service is binded to the branch, you can also create a new domain for dev environment to check the online status of the service.
