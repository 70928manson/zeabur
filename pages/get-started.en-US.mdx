# Get Started

Deploy your service to Zeabur from scratch in just three steps:

### Step 1: Sign Up

On the deploy service page, you can select the left button to automatically build and deploy your source code from GitHub.

Select the right button to choose a service from a list of common services (such as a database or an open source tool). Zeabur will automatically create a service instance for you.

### What's Next

After deployed, you can learn about [domain binding](/en-US/deploy/domain-binding) to expose your service with an automatically configured TLS certificate, or learn about [environment variables](/en-US/variables) to understand how Zeabur can automatically inject variables into your program.
