# Deploy Laravel

This article will teach you how to deploy your [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) project on Zeabur.

## Step 1: Environment Configuration

You can test and build locally first to make sure your project can run normally. You must apply your PHP version in composer.json for Zeabur to deploy.
```groovy
"require": {
        "php": "8.1",
    }
```

## Step 2: Create a Project (Optional)

First, you need to initialize a Laravel project in your local development environment. We can follow the instructions in the [Laravel official document](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x) to complete this step

After creation, initialize a Git repository for it and deploy it to your Github.

## Step 3: Deploy Laravel Project

In your project, click the **Deploy service** or **Add new service** button, and select **Deploy your source code**.
