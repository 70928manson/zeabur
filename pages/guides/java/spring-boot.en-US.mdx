# Deploy Spring Boot

This article will teach you how to deploy your [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) project on Zeabur.

## Step 1: Environment Configuration

You can test and build locally first to make sure your project can run normally. You can use JDK version: 19, 17, 8, 7.

## Step 2: Create a Project (Optional)

First, you need to initialize a Spring Boot project in your local development environment. We can follow the instructions in the [Spring Boot official document](https://spring.io/quickstart) to complete this step, or initialize a Spring Boot project according to your favorite IDE (such as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)).

If you use the **Gradle deployment tool**, you need to open the `build.gradle` file in the Gradle project and add the following settings:

```groovy
jar {
    enabled = false
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': 'com.example.demo.DemoApplication' // <-- Please replace with your own main class
    }
}
```

After creation, initialize a Git repository for it and deploy it to your Github.

## Step 3: Deploy Spring Boot Project

In your project, click the **Deploy service** or **Add new service** button, and select **Deploy your source code**.
