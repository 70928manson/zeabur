# Custom Root Directory

For some Git repositories, such as projects with both frontend and backend, you need to manually specify the project root directory.

### Step 1: Deploy the service

Follow the [Deploy the service](/en-US/get-started) to deploy your application

## Step 2: Change the project root directory

Click on the deployed service and enter the settings page, scroll down to the **Root Directory** column

Enter the root directory you want to specify, and click Save. After saving successfully, click **Redeploy Service** to redeploy your service. The service will be rebuilt and executed according to the specified root directory.
