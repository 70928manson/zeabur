Click on the service which you want to add a domain for, and choose the settings page, you will see two buttons for you to create a domain for your service.

### Step 3: Add DNS Record for Your Customized Domain

If your domain is customized (without zeabur.app suffix), you need to add a DNS record for it.  

As for how to add this, you can refer to [this article](https://www.itprotoday.com/compute-engines/how-do-i-add-record-dns).

### What's Next

After the domain is provisioned, you can click on it to take a visit to it.
