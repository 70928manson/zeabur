## Step 2: Create a Domain

Zeabur provides an easy service for generating domain names with the zeabur.app suffix that can be used to access your services without additional configuration.

You can also choose to fully customize your domain name, but you will need to see step 3 to do some configuration for it.

## Step 3: Configure Your Customized Domain

For more uniqueness and flexibility, you can also choose to bundle your own domain name, or if you don't have one yet, you can buy it from some domain name service providers, such as [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com) or [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) Purchase.

### Configure DNS record

After you have added your dedicated domain name to the service, in order to access your service properly, you need to go to your domain registrar and manually configure DNS records for your domain name.

Open the Cloudflare console, select the domain name you want to configure, and select DNS records.
