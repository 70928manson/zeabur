# Introduction

**Zeabur** is a platform that help you deploy your service with one click,
No matter what programming language you use, what framework you use.

### Advantages of Zeabur

#### Convenient and Fast

Compared to traditional deployment methods, Zeabur allows you to complete deployment in just a few minutes without spending a lot of time learning about deployment-related knowledge. This allows you to focus your time and energy on product development.

- Out-of-the-box CI/CD
- Automatic project type recognition
- Quickly generate domains
- Multiple environment isolation

#### Pay-as-You-Go

Zeabur adopts a pay-as-you-go billing method, which means you only need to pay for the actual resources used by your service, instead of paying for the entire server.

You can learn more detailed information on [the pricing document](/en-US/billing/pricing).

#### All-in-One Integration

Zeabur provides powerful all-in-one integration capabilities.

You can deploy various services such as front-end, back-end, databases, message queues, and object storage in one project, without having to deploy them separately to different platforms.

### Supported Frameworks and Languages

#### Node.js

All Node.js projects can be deployed, but you need to add `build` and `start` commands to the `scripts` field in `package.json`.

<Callout emoji="âœ…">
  If your project is initialized with a framework (such as the frameworks listed below), they have already set the `build` and `start` commands for you, so you don't need to set them yourself.
</Callout>

In particular, the following frameworks can be automatically recognized by Zeabur and optimized accordingly:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Remix](https://remix.run/)
- [Umi.js](https://umijs.org/)
- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)
- [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
- [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/)
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

The following package managers are currently supported:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/)

#### Java

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)

#### Go

All projects based on [Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) can be deployed. But you need to have a `main.go` in the project root directory as the program compilation entry.

If you have multiple program compilation entries, you need to put them in the `cmd` directory, for example, a `cmd/server-a/main.go` and a `cmd/server-b/main.go`.

Zeabur will automatically recognize and deploy the program compilation entry with the same Service name under the `cmd` directory.

#### Python

If your project root directory has `main.py` or `app.py`, Zeabur will automatically deploy it as a Python project.

You need to write the external packages your project needs in the `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock` file, so that Zeabur can automatically install them before building.

In particular, the following frameworks can be automatically recognized by Zeabur and optimized accordingly:

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

If you want to deploy a Django project, please make sure that your project root directory has `manage.py` and at least one subdirectory has `wsgi.py`.

#### Deno

If your project root directory has `deno.json` or `fresh.gen.ts`, Zeabur will automatically deploy it as a Deno project.

You need to add `start` command to the `tasks` field in `deno.json`.

If your project is initialized with Fresh framework, they have already set the `start` command for you, so you don't need to set them yourself.

- [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/)

#### Static website

All static websites can be deployed, but you need to have an `index.html` in the project root directory as the website entry.

In particular, Zeabur can recognize and optimize static websites generated by the following static website generation frameworks:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)

#### MongoDB

You can deploy a MongoDB service through Zeabur, and you can automatically inject it into the environment variables of other services in the same environment to let your other services connect to the MongoDB database.

Go to [Environment variables](/environment/variables) to learn more about environment variables.

#### Redis

You can deploy a Redis service through Zeabur, and you can automatically inject it into the environment variables of other services in the same environment to let your other services connect to the Redis database.

Go to [Environment variables](/environment/variables) to learn more about environment variables.

#### MySQL

You can deploy a MySQL service through Zeabur, and you can automatically inject it into the environment variables of other services in the same environment to let your other services connect to the MySQL database.

Go to [Environment variables](/environment/variables) to learn more about environment variables.

#### PostgreSQL

You can deploy a PostgreSQL service through Zeabur, and you can automatically inject it into the environment variables of other services in the same environment to let your other services connect to the PostgreSQL database.

Go to [Environment variables](/environment/variables) to learn more about environment variables.
