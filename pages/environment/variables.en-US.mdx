# Setting Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure your application.
Zeabur provides a way to set environment variables for your service.

You can set environment variables in the **Variables** tab of your service, and you can **Add Variables** to your service.

Zeabur will automatically inject these environment variables into your service.

- `<YOUR_SERVICE_NAME>_HOST`：The host of the service.

- `PORT`：The port of the service

- Other variables like database credentials([PostgreSQL](/databases/postgresql)) or [Redis](/databases/redis) connection string and so on.

And you don't need to set the environment variables manually.
