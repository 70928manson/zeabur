# Multi Environment

You may need some independent environments in a project, such as production and development environment.

Zeabur can help you with that.

### Step 1: Create a new environment

Click the create-environment button in the top left corner to create a new environment.

After the environment is created, your services in the current project will be automatically copied, and re-deploy in your new environment.

### Step 2: Bind another branch

For your deployed source code, you can bind different branches in different environment for the same service.

Click on the service and get into the settings tab, drop down to the **Switch Branch**, choose the branch that you want to bind in this environment.

For example, if you choose the dev branch, then your service is binded to the branch, you can also create a new domain for dev environment to check the online status of the service.
